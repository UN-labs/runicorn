I am only so creative, so the fantasy story only lasted for one page :)

You team has spent one rainbow of effort on focusing their efforts on beefing up the unit tests.  A "few" existed before, but they were admittedly sparse and clearly not the focus of the development team.

With the whole team focusing on writing unit tests, the developeers are learning to test better, in general.  This goes beyond just higher coverage of code in the unit tests, but also, the collaboration has had a two-way learning effect.  The testers are learning more about the codebase and the developers are learning more about how the testers are thinking when they test the software.

The higher coverage with unit tests helps the code to be more maintainable, and as different people work in different areas of the code, it is easier for them to understand what is going on.

The team is seeing the benefits of unit tests, but it feels like not much was done that is visible to the business owners during that time. They have a hard time seeing the benefits of these lower level tests. They are feeling antsy and want to see more results, sooner.  Rainbows are expensive, ya know ...

Some team members feel like the team should continue focusing on these lower level tests, given the benefits that have been seen.  These team members have heard of other teams who aim for 100% code coverage in their unit tests, and the benefits that they see from that target.

Some team members want to see more focus given to the higher level tests that exist. After all, these are poorly written Selenium tests that have a lot of duplication and are currently run separately by testers, only after code has been updated and deployed to the testing server.  

These team members have heard that there are testing framworks out there where the tests are written in plain English as scenarios, and the scenarios and the code that executes them are written via collaboration between testers and developers, and easily run as development is happening.  They have been hearing a lot of people talk about Behavior Driven Development, and want to try working that way.
